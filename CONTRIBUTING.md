## What should I know before I get started?

### Build with Yeoman

This project, generator-helix, is build with [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/). Yeoman helps you to kickstart new projects, prescribing best practices and tools to help you stay productive.

To do so, it provides a generator ecosystem. A generator is basically a plugin that can be run with the `yo` command to scaffold complete projects or useful parts.

Inside we're utilizing the "Yeoman workflow". This workflow is a robust and opinionated client-side stack, comprising tools and frameworks that can help developers quickly build applications. We take care of providing everything needed to get started without any of the normal headaches associated with a manual setup.

It would be wise to read up on the basics of Yeoman to get an understanding on the concepts before diving into contributing to the project.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue in this repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started generator-helix, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started it otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of generator-helix) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of generator-helix?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of generator-helix from [the releases page](https://github.com/PentiaLabs/generator-helix/releases).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?
